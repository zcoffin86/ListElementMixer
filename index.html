    <h1>List Element Mixer</h1>
    <div id="description">
        <p>
            Welcome to the List Element Mixer! This tool allows you to create and manage multiple lists of items,
            including sub-lists for more granular selection. You can load lists from text files, save them as presets,
            and generate random combinations of items from each list.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, click "Add List" to create a new list column. Use the "Pick a .txt File" button to load
            items
            into the list. The format of the .txt file should have main items on separate lines and sub-items indented
            with
            a tab character. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
Unicorn
    (Celestial)
    (Midnight)
Dragon
    (Fire-breathing)
    (Ice-breathing)
Phoenix
    (Flame)
    (Ashen)
Centaur
    (Forest-dwelling)
    (Desert-dwelling)
Mermaid
    (Ocean-dwelling)
    (River-dwelling)
Griffin
    (Golden-feathered)
    (Storm-feathered)
Gnome
    (Garden-dwelling)
    (Mountain-dwelling)
Satyr
    (Woodland)
    (Mountain)
Faerie
    (Summer)
    (Winter)
        </pre>
        <p>
            When you first load the page, you'll find four pre-loaded lists to help you get started. These initial lists
            include various species, occupations, actions/emotions, and locations, designed to inspire whimsical fantasy
            scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can save your current lists as presets and load them later. The "Generate Output" button will randomly
            select
            an item from each list and combine them into a single output string. If a main item has sub-items, one
            sub-item
            will be randomly selected and appended to the main item. Each browser tab can maintain its own lists
            independently,
            but all tabs can access and save presets to a central repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the "Delete List" button to remove a list from the page and from session storage. Use the "Save Preset"
            button
            to save your current lists configuration, and the "Load Preset" button to load a saved preset. You can also
            delete
            saved presets using the "Delete Preset" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy mixing and may your illustrations be full of whimsy and fantasy!
