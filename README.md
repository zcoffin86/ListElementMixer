# ListElementMixer
Given some input lists, generate a string using random elements from each list. The entire project source code was written by ChatGPT from my prompts. I can't promise it will always be that way, but for now, it's going pretty well. Prompt engineering is fun, but even at the current scale, the generative AI is starting to throw me some curveballs. In particular, there's not good consistency. For example, when I ask for a simple update to the HTML, the result includes some other changes that I didn't ask for, and sometimes those are even breaking changes (since things no longer align with what the javascript expects.) It would be interesting to try this out along with GitHub Copilot.
